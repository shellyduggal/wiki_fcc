					<h3>"And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin."</h3>

					<p>"It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line," began the Englishman. "I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time. Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went milling and milling round so, that my boat's crew could only trim dish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white head and hump, all crows' feet and wrinkles."</p>

					<h3>The Martians, alarmed by the approach</h3>

					<p>The Martians, alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number of people with a quick-firing gun, so the story ran.  The telegram concluded with the words: "Formidable as they seem to be, the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have fallen, and, indeed, seem incapable of doing so.

					<h3>Picking up my sword I leaned upon it,</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="summary">
					<p>Picking up my sword I leaned upon it, looking down on the dead body of my foeman, and as I thought of the battle I had just fought and won a great idea was born in my brain&mdash;the outcome of this and the suggestion that Perry had made within the city of Phutra.  If skill and science could render a comparative pygmy the master of this mighty brute, what could not the brute's fellows accomplish with the same skill and science.  Why all Pellucidar would be at their feet&mdash;and I would be their king and Dian their queen.</p>
